alfred2-dictcc-lookup
=====================

Alfred 2 workflow for querying [dict.cc](http://www.dict.cc), with support for suggestions and previews.

**NOTE:** This is my first exposure to Go and should be considered a toy project. If you're looking for something immediately usable, there are a couple of projects doing essentially the same thing,
like https://github.com/elkatwork/alfred-dict.cc-workflow
